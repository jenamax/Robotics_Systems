	\section{Virtual Joints model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Consider each of three legs separately. The model for them are same the only difference is axis of rotations and translations of links and joints.
		
		\item Inverse kinematics for one leg:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item z coordinate defined by a prismatic joint position $q_1$ = z
			\item $q_2$ and $q_3$ can be found as inverse kinematics for planar 2d manipulator: \\
			\begin{math}
				q_3 = \arccos(\frac{x^2 + y^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}) \\
				q2 = \arctan(\frac{y}{x}) - \arctan(\frac{L_2 \sin(q_3)}{L_1 + L_2 \cos(q_3)})
			\end{math}
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item For every leg there are 4 virtual joints. One is 1d (after active prismatic joint) and 3 6d (after each link).
		
		\item So the direct kinematics for this robot can be written as follows: \\
		\begin{math}
			T = T_{z}(q_1)T_{z}(\theta _{1})T_{6d}(\theta _{2})R_{z}(q_2)T_{x}(L_1)T_{6d}(\theta _3)R_z(q_3)T_x(L_2)T_{6d}(\theta _4)R_z(q_4)
		\end{math}
		
		\item After that we construct $K_\theta$ matrix base on arbitrarily chosen values of stiffness properties of links and active joints
		
		\item Then build deflection map for the robot by measurement end-effector displacement in some set of points x, y (z chose as constant since end-effector move on one plane):
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each point compute inverse kinematics assuming that virtual joints positions are 0 (since they are small)
			
			\item Compute Jacobians by virtual joints positions $J_\theta$ and passive joints $J_q$
			
			\item Compute stiffness matrix $K_C$
			
			\item Compute end-effector displacement: $\Delta t = K_C^{-1}W$
			
		\end{enumerate} 
		\item Deflection map plots: 
		
	\end{itemize}
